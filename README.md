# odin-recipes

This project focuses on creating a simple recipes site based on The
Odin Project's [HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations)
lessons. This means working with text, lists, links, images, and
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
